# 🚗 Dynamic Parking Price Optimization using Pathway

This project implements a real-time dynamic pricing system for parking spaces using the **Pathway** stream processing engine and **Bokeh** for visualization.

We simulate and analyze data from a smart parking system to design two pricing models that respond to real-time demand and traffic conditions.
